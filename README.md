# Python-Educational-Projects
Projects showing understanding of Python development.
Python is the language that I have the most experience in, although I haven't worked with it for long (started in May 2020, currently 6 months of experience).
I enjoy working with it greatly, but I need much more time with it.
I have a little bit of experience with data analysis and machine learning. Those are probably the topics that I want to delve into the most eventually.
