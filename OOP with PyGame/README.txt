This is a project showcasing Object Oriented Programming in conjunction with PyGame.

This is a program showing several blobs that move around in a window.
When blue touches green, green's area is absorbed into blue.
When blue touches red, if red is bigger than blue, blue's area is absorbed into red. If blue is bigger, both red and blue are reduced by red's area (killing red).
Red and green have no interactions and will merely pass through each other.
